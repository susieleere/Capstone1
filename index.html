    <h2>Summary | Objective Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Susie Lee and I am excited to explore a new path in my life of Web Development! I have no background
        in this field whatsoever, but I hope I can use the learnings from this course to jumpstart my interest that may lead to 
        my brand new start up idea. I am super excited to integrate my knowledge with my current background to create a completely 
        new concept that the world has yet to see. I want to show that anyone who tries their best to venture on a business on their own
        can succeed with their own efforts if they give their passion everything they have. 
    </br>Go Disruptors!
    </p>
